# What new skills have you learned?
	* I learned how to structure the HTML document and how it can be represented in a tree structure;
	* I learned that it is important to think about the elements I use in the HTML to be semantically correct. It is important for both its maintenance and accessibility;
	
# What has been easy?
	Since I knew a bit about HTML, it was easy to create HTML structure request in the exercices;
	
# What has been difficult?
	It seems like there are a lot of elements that have a specific purpose, and it seems difficult to learn all of them. But I guess that practice will simplify it.
	
# How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	By knowing that I can't learn all at once. And that even if it seems a lot to remember, practice will make it easier.
