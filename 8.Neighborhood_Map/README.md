# Neighborhood Map

This project consists of a single page app that shows cool spots of a town that I picked. The user can further add some cools spots that he found nearby the city.

The page can be accessed [here](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-web-front-end/8.Neighborhood_Map/dist/index.html).

## Getting Started

To properly deploy the project, please see the [README](../README.md) file located at the project's root.

## APIs Used

This project uses both the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com).

## Google Map Styles

The style I'm using was designed by **Lucas Santana** and can be found [here](https://snazzymaps.com/style/8356/flat).
