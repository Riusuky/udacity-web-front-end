# Neighborhood Map

This project consists of a single page app that shows cool spots of a town that I picked. The user can further add some cools spots that he found nearby the city.

A hosted version of the App can be accessed [here](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-web-front-end/8.Neighborhood_Map/dist/index.html).

## Getting Started

To install all the project's dependencies, please see the [`README`](../README.md) file located at the repository's root first.

To run the Grunt task associated with this project, run `grunt neighborhoodMap` where the `Gruntfile.js` file is located. This will create/refresh the `dist` folder based on the `src` folder content. Thus, all your custom modification must be made at the `src` folder, otherwise, you'd lose your work.

To open the project, simply use your preferred browser to open the `dist/index.html` file.

## APIs Used

This project uses both the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com).

## Google Map Styles

The style I'm using was designed by **Lucas Santana** and can be found [here](https://snazzymaps.com/style/8356/flat).
