# 1 : Don't give up! At least not yet!

* Do not tackle the problem like a wild beast. Give it some time to think 
about the problem at sight. What objectives do I have to achieve in order 
to reach the solution? Do I have all the knowledge to fullfill these 
objectives? Manage you time to be objective and to gradually build your 
knowledge and solution over steps. Do not lose focus, it might be a huge 
cliff, but you can reach the top step by step;

* If you can't find the answer, focus on the question. Search for help! 
Someone might have had the same problems you are having, and he/she 
probably has a good solution for it. Always check the community for 
"state-of-art solutions" before deciding the path you'll choose;

* Learn from your messes! How and why my project got so messed up? Was it a 
decision I took or the way a implemented it? Is there a way to avoid this? 
Try to identify what makes you or someone else unconfortable about your 
work and learn from it. Good critic is *always* welcome;

* Keep it simple you fool! It's better to have a simple and functional 
solution than a complex and do-all-and-more solution that will be 40% used 
with a lot of bugs that will cause you nightmares. Be sure that the things 
you are planning to implemment are really necessary.

# 2 : Why I'm studying Web Front-End development

* Developing new ideas into web applications is relatively cheap and can 
reach a huge amount of people. With low risk and good reward, why wouldn't 
I try to put some effort on the idea;

* At my previous work and in my personal projects with friends, there 
was/is a lack someone good at front-end development;

* I see an interesting future for web development and would like to be 
engaged.
