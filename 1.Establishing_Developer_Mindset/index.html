    <h1>1 : Don't give up! At least not yet!</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not tackle the problem like a wild beast. Give it some time to think
        about the problem at sight. What objectives do I have to achieve in order
        to reach the solution? Do I have all the knowledge to fullfill these
        objectives? Manage you time to be objective and to gradually build your
        knowledge and solution over steps. Do not lose focus, it might be a huge
        cliff, but you can reach the top step by step;
      </li>

      <li>
        If you can't find the answer, focus on the question. Search for help!
        Someone might have had the same problems you are having, and he/she
        probably has a good solution for it. Always check the community for
        "state-of-art solutions" before deciding the path you'll choose;
      </li>

      <li>
        Learn from your messes! How and why my project got so messed up? Was it a
        decision I took or the way a implemented it? Is there a way to avoid this?
        Try to identify what makes you or someone else unconfortable about your
        work and learn from it. Good critic is *always* welcome;
      </li>

      <li>
        Keep it simple you fool! It's better to have a simple and functional
        solution than a complex and do-all-and-more solution that will be 40% used
        with a lot of bugs that will cause you nightmares. Be sure that the things
        you are planning to implemment are really necessary.

    <h1>2 : Why I'm studying Web Front-End development</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Developing new ideas into web applications is relatively cheap and can
        reach a huge amount of people. With low risk and good reward, why wouldn't
        I try to put some effort on the idea;
      </li>

      <li>
        At my previous work and in my personal projects with friends, there
        was/is a lack someone good at front-end development;
      </li>

      <li>
        I see an interesting future for web development and would like to be
        engaged.
