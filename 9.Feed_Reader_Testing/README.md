# Feed Reader Testing

The objective of this project was to write test suites (using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)) for a existing [project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

The proposed implementation of test suites are located at the file [`feedreader.js`](jasmine\spec\feedreader.js).

A hosted version of the page that run the tests can be accessed [here](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-web-front-end/9.Feed_Reader_Testing/index.html).

## Getting Started

To open the project, simply use your preferred browser to open the `index.html` file.

After the page loads, the tests will run automatically and the result will be displayed on the page.
