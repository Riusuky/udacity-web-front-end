# Udacity Web Front End (Still in progress!)

This repository is meant to show all of my Udacity's Web Front End Nanodegree project submissions. All of its content can be viewed [here](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-web-front-end/).


## Getting Started

Since the project uses the task runner [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) ([Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js)) to perform optimizations and process images, you need to install all of its dependencies ([package.json](package.json)).

To install all dependencies just run `npm install` (Make sure you have npm installed before running it).

To run all tasks for all projects, just run `grunt`.
