# Udacity Web Front End (Still in progress!)

This repository is meant to show all of my Udacity's Web Front End Nanodegree project submissions. All of its content can be viewed in [this](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-web-front-end/) hosted version.

## Getting Started

Since the project uses the task runner [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) ([`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js)) to process images and perform optimizations, you need to install all of its dependencies ([`package.json`](package.json)).

Before installing the dependencies, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Grunt CLI](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed.

To install all dependencies just run `npm install` where the `package.json` file is located.

To run all Grunt tasks for all projects, just run `grunt` where the `Gruntfile.js` file is located.

If you intend to host a project on a local server, you could use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package for simplicity.

Each project may contain its own `README` file with its own **Getting Started** section for further instructions on how to make your adjustments/modification or simply open the project.
